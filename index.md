Welcome to my blog! I'm [brokenphilip](https://brokenphilip.carrd.co/), and [BulbToys](https://github.com/bulbtoys) is my passion project - a result of my love towards reverse-engineering for the past decade.

It's pretty vacant in here right now, but I plan to dedicate this blog to my reverse-engineering adventures, primarily involving the project, but also generally more technical things I wouldn't otherwise post on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/brokenphilip).
